I am a product of the American dream. My father is a self-made man and my mother is a nurse. I have two brothers: an accountant, and a petroleum engineer. Today, they own a ranch in a small east Texas town where they enjoy coastal sailing and horse-back riding. Their life together, however, starts with poverty and a desire to see a prosperous family. That's the life to which I was born.

At the beginning of it all, my family was fighting for our nightly meal. There was a certain day when I recieved a tongue lashing because I told my dad that we had seven dollars instead of six to get gas. We dug our milk money from beneath the couch cushions and watched Power Rangers on an old 8 inch TV that sat atop a dusty bookshelf in the living room.

Adversity is the great catalyst for advancement. Since we could hardly even afford second-hand clothes, the majority of our family entertainment was found in the library. In the library, I unlocked the greatest treasure chest ever set before me. I unlocked the passion for learning. It was in the library in my early years that I learned the several dozens species of sharks and fish. It was in the library that I discovered a deep desire to explore worlds beyond my own: whether inside the pages of a fantasy-fiction or the worlds beyond our solar system. The vast riches that can be found by simply opening the pages of some dusty tome still astounds me.

I write these things to share a bit of my world with you. To be completely transparent, the world does not need another blog. We already live in a world where any individual can express his thoughts to the world without really having to live with the consequences. No, I will not write another blog. However, I write because I sincerely wish to bring value those around me.

> the most noble end of wealth is to give it away

I am a software engineer. I have come far in my world and learned more than I could ever have dreamed as a young boy. I ride forward on the backs of those who carry me. I am no special man, but I am a rich man. I am rich because I have hoarded away each and every penny's worth of knowledge I could find. And as many can confirm, the most noble end of wealth is to give it away. The beautiful thing about knowledge, however, is that the more you give away, the more that you gain.

Therefore, I wish to give to you. I have learned much since I picked up my first book on [Visual Basic](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471355992/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i7) (at age 11 - though to be fair I usually just copied the code and changed the colors). I have worked on small remote teams building simple webapps, as well as engineered applications for Fortune 500 companies with several billion dollars in assets. I've read several books, watched many tutorials, written countless unit tests and broken even more builds. I've seen friends burn out and brought noobs into this incredible business. I've mentored offshore teams and taught in small advanced environments. It is my purpose to share what I have learned, in hopes, that you may find value in the things that I have.

### To be specific, I am passionate about these topics:

- Building Software that Lasts
- Scalable Design patterns
- Writing good code but writing it _quickly_
- Raising up our juniors
- Web Development
- Choosing good tools
- Knowing and understanding your technology tradeoffs
- Learning new things

### Finally, this is the tech that I love:

- Python
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- React
- WebAssembly
- Rust

If you've made it to the end, then I hope something I've written has tugged at you. Over the course of this blog, I hope that the experience I've gained and the knowledge I've hoarded will propel you forward into the world with passion and vigor.
